## ReAct Mechanism

This implementation incorporates a reflection mechanism inspired by self-reflective AI principles:
1. **Reasoning Generation**: The agent first generates reasoning steps based on the current problem.
2. **Action Execution**: Executes actions (e.g., querying a database or performing calculations) to gather required information.
3. **Reflection and Improvement**: Evaluates results, refines reasoning, and adjusts subsequent actions iteratively.

This feedback loop ensures robust problem-solving, minimizing errors and optimizing decision-making.
