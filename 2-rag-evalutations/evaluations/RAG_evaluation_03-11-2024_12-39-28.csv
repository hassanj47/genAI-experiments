0,What is prompt engineering?,"Here is a 3-sentence answer:

Prompt engineering refers to methods for communicating with LLMs to steer their behavior towards desired outcomes without updating model weights. It aims to achieve alignment and model steerability, which can vary among models, requiring experimentation and heuristics. The goal of prompt engineering is to improve the controllability of autoregressive language models, particularly in tasks like text generation.","Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.
This post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable text generation.
[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.

To construct chain-of-thought prompts automatically, Shum et al. (2023) suggested augment-prune-select, a three-step process:

Augment: Generate multiple pseudo-chains of thought given question using few-shot or zero-shot CoT prompts;
Prune: Prune pseudo chains based on whether generated answers match ground truths.
Select: Apply a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to learn the probability distribution over selected examples, while considering the probability distribution over examples as policy and the validation set accuracy as reward.","Prompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights.

1. Providing context and relevant information to help the model understand the task, as mentioned in Weng's article on Prompt Engineering.
2. Using retrieval methods to access external knowledge bases or recent information, followed by incorporating retrieved content into the prompt, as discussed in the Retrieval section.
3. Utilizing techniques such as prompt engineering, prompt augmentation, and selection to optimize the effectiveness of prompts, as explored in various research papers and resources listed in the Useful Resources section.","Augmented Language Models#
A survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.
Retrieval#
Often we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don’t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\nWeng, Lilian. (Mar 2023). Prompt Engineering.

To mitigate these biases, calibration methods have been proposed to adjust label probabilities to be uniform when input strings are N/A.","Basic Prompting#
Zero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.
Zero-Shot#
Zero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.

Few-shot#
Few-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.

Sentiment:
Many studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near SoTA.
Zhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.
Tips for Example Selection#


Choose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\nReferences#

(2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.


Tips for Example Ordering#

A general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.
Increasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)",(1) Majority label bias exists if the distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens.,0.8,"{'relevance_score': 0.8, 'total_relevant_statements': 4, 'total_statements_in_context': 9}",0.5,"{'recall_score': 0.5, 'total_attributed_statements': 3, 'total_statements_in_reference': 6}",0.5,"{'faithfulness_score': 0.5, 'total_inferred_claims': 3, 'total_claims': 4}",8
3,What is Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting?,"Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a method that involves repeatedly prompting the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively, using external search queries or Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content. CoT prompts can be used to explore multiple reasoning possibilities at each step, creating a tree structure of thoughts. The search process can be performed using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).","Self-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.

Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\text{score}(e_i) = P_\text{LM}(y \mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.

Question clustering: Embed questions and run $k$-means for clustering.
Demonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.
Rationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.\nFig. 2. How Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Yao et al. 2022).
Automatic Prompt Design#
Prompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting  desired output given input.

This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.
APE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\nEach API call is represented as a tuple of (API name, corresponding input), $c=(a_c, i_c)$ and its corresponding result is denoted as $r$. The API call sequences with and without results are labeled as follows, respectively:

  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  e(c) &= \langle\texttt{API}\rangle a_c(i_c) \langle\texttt{/API}\rangle \\
  e(c, r) &= \langle\texttt{API}\rangle a_c(i_c) \to r \langle\texttt{/API}\rangle
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  


Sample API calls based on the probabilities $p_\text{LM}(\langle\texttt{API}\rangle \mid \text{prompt}(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x}_{1:i})$ and select top $k$ candidate positions for doing API calls at position $i$ if the probability is larger than a threshold.",Self-consistency sampling is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then select the best one out of these candidates.

APE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\nPrompt Engineering, also known as In-Context Prompting, refers to methods for how to communicate with LLM to steer its behavior for desired outcomes without updating the model weights. It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.
This post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable text generation.
[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.

(2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.


Tips for Example Ordering#

A general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.
Increasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\nBasic Prompting#
Zero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.
Zero-Shot#
Zero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.
(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)
Text: i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.
Sentiment:
Few-shot#
Few-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.
Text: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.
Sentiment: positive\nInstruction Prompting#
The purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?
Instructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.
When interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.

The sentiment label should be ""positive"" or ""negative"".","Keep the selection of examples diverse and relevant to the test sample, and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.

Semantic Kernel\nFig. 4. The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).
TALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.

Fig. 5. Self-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).
Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\nFine-tune LM on this annotated dataset. The new training sequences are constructed as $\mathbf{x}^* = x_{1:i-1}, e(c_i, r_i), x_{i:n}$ . The training data is a combination of the original dataset (e.g. a subset of CCNet, as in the paper) and its augmented version.


At inference time, decoding runs until the model produces “$\to$ "" token, indicating that it is expecting response from an API call next.
Toolformer currently does not support tool use in a chain (i.e. using the output of one tool as an input for another tool) or in an interactive way (i.e. adopt API response after human selection). Both are interesting future directions to expand the model for.

Self-Consistency Sampling#
Self-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates.
The criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT)#
Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.

(2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\text{score}(e_i) = P_\text{LM}(y \mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.


Some researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)


Motivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.


Tips for Example Ordering#\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\{p\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.
For closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.

It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, essentially creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\nFig. 2.

Automatic Prompt Design#
Prompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting  desired output given input. Therefore we can treat them as trainable parameters and optimize them directly on the embedding space via gradient descent, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020, Prefix-Tuning (Li & Liang (2021)), P-tuning (Liu et al. 2021) and Prompt-Tuning (Lester et al. 2021). This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.
APE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:
Generate some knowledge about the input. Examples:\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\text{LM}(a \mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\text{LM}(q \mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\text{LM}(q \mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.
One observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.",Self-Ask is a method where the model is prompted to ask follow-up questions iteratively to construct a thought process. These questions can then be answered using external tools like search engines or APIs to guide the model towards a more accurate response.,0.67,"{'relevance_score': 0.67, 'total_relevant_statements': 4, 'total_statements_in_context': 6}",0.5,"{'recall_score': 0.5, 'total_attributed_statements': 2, 'total_statements_in_reference': 4}",0.5,"{'faithfulness_score': 0.5, 'total_inferred_claims': 2, 'total_claims': 4}",8
16,How does the Self-Ask method integrate with external tools?,"I don't know how the Self-Ask method integrates with external tools, but it can be integrated by using search engine results to answer follow-up questions. This is similar to IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT) and ReAct, which combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content. The integration process involves using external search queries to provide additional context and information to the model.","Self-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.

The format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).
TALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.

Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\nAugmented Language Models#
A survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.
Retrieval#
Often we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don’t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.","Self-Ask can be combined with methods like IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT) and ReAct (Reason + Act), where the model uses external tools like Wikipedia APIs to retrieve relevant information and add it back into the context for reasoning.",0.5,"{'relevance_score': 0.5, 'total_relevant_statements': 2, 'total_statements_in_context': 4}",0.5,"{'recall_score': 0.5, 'total_attributed_statements': 2, 'total_statements_in_reference': 4}",0.5,"{'faithfulness_score': 0.5, 'total_inferred_claims': 2, 'total_claims': 4}",6
