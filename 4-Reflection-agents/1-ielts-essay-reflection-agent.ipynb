Moreover, the loss of traditional media literacy skills, such as critical thinking and discernment, leaves individuals vulnerable to manipulation. It is essential that we develop strategies to mitigate these risks.\\n\\nTo achieve this, governments and educators must work together to promote media literacy, regulate social media platforms, and foster critical thinking skills.
